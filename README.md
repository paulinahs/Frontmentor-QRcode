## My process
Dumped all the HTML/content and the styled with CSS.
Tried to be as simple and straightforward as possible.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I tried to be as simple as possible when doing this porject from scratch as it is the first one I do without following a specific tutorial.

### Continued development
I would love to learn an easier way to center the card as I believe my CSS styling is too basic, but it does the job so far.
